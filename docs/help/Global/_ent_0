#---Global--_ent_0
    Global: _ent_0 PRGDIR PRG
      Desc: _ent_0, PRGDIR and PRG are global variables that are initialised
          : every time entities.bash is sourced.  They are not exported.
          :   _ent_0   is the fully-qualified path of the calling program.
          :   PRGDIR   is the directory location of the calling program.
          :   PRG      is the basename of the calling program.
          : PRG is most often used to identify a running script.
          : PRGDIR is used to identify the directory location of the running
          : script, which often comes in handy.
   Example: 0. source entities.bash
          :    # If entities.bash has already been loaded,
          :    # then only _ent_0, PRGDIR and PRG globals are initialised.
          :    # If entities.bash has not been loaded, then a full load/reload
          :    # of all functions and global variables is done also.
          : 1. source entities.bash new
          :    # ^ load new instance of entities.bash;
          :    # do not use any existing instance already loaded.
    Source: /usr/share/okusi/entities/entities.bash
