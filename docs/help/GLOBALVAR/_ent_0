   Example: 0. source entities.bash
          :    # If entities.bash has already been loaded,
          :    # then only _ent_0, PRGDIR and PRG globals are initialised.
          :    # If entities.bash has not been loaded, then a full load/reload
          :    # of all functions and global variables is done also.
          : 
          : 1. source entities.bash new
          :    # ^ load new instance of entities.bash;
          :    # do not use any existing instance already loaded.
